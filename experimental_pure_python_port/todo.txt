Don't forget -- 
-- bug in zlansvdw.f, needs to pass lzwrk and use that in "Set pointers into work array" (lwrk = lzwrk-iwrk+1)

-- bug in call to zgemmina? once again, conflating lwrk and lzwrk:
               call zgemmina(n,j,j,V,ldv,
     c           work(iq),lanmax,zwork(iwrk),lwrk) 



- address FIXMEs
- Lots of places where I provide an array bound (e.g. uuu[:, :n]) where it's probably not necessary because the array is already of size N. This is a leftover from the Fortran code where every array length & index has to be specified explicitly.
- document coding style, variable name choices
