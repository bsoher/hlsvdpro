Version 2.0.0 - 17 June, 2020
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This is a realease of HLSVDPRO version 2.0.0

HLSVDPRO 2.0.0 has been adaptated to use PROPACK library version 2.1 to 
implement the HLSVDPRO algorithm as described in:

  T. Laudadio, N. Mastronardi, L. Vanhamme, P. Van Hecke and S. Van Huffel, 
  "Improved Lanczos algorithms for blackbox MRS data quantitation", Journal of 
  Magnetic Resonance, Volume 157, pages 292-297, 2002. 

The python wrapper used to access the PROPACK library was adapted from the 
pypropack repository create by Jake van der Plas on Github: 
  https://github.com/jakevdp/pypropack 
with extensions by Brian J Soher to include the matrix-vector product 
calculation within the Fortran code. 

The HLSVDPRO version 1.0.1 wheels will remain on PyPI in case users need to 
downgrade for any reason.

The HLSVDPRO version 2.0.0 algorithm is accessed via:
  hlsvdpro.hlsvd()     for version 1.x API, or
  hlsvdpro.hlsvdpro()  for version 2.x API, or
  
See the help string for further information on the API.

HLSVDPRO provides access to the underlying PROPACK SVD algorithms via:
  hlsvdpro.propack()


Version 1.0.1 - 12 April 2017
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This release contains a few small changes --
 - Re-added missing constants.
 - Removed demo code from distribution
 - Fix a Fortran bug that reportedly causes a segfault:

Version 1.0.0 - 6 April 2017
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This is the first release of HLSVDPRO as an independent package. Previously, it
had been included as a sub-package of the Vespa - Versatile Simulation Pulses
and Analysis package at Duke University for magnetic resonance spectroscopy
spectral simulation and processing. We split it off as a standalone package to
make it more generally available.

HLSVDPRO version 1.0.x was implemented based on the paper by W.W.F. Pijnappel, 
A. van den Boogaart, R. de Beer, D. van Ormondt, J. Magn. Reson. 97, 122 (1992)
and made use of code from PROPACK version 1.x. It requires the fftw library, 
which is included as part of this version of the package.

HLSVDPRO version 1.0.x is compatible with Python 2.7 and 3.x. The binaries
that the Python wrapper calls are 64-bit, so this code is not compatible with
32-bit Python.
